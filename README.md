# Transcendence 🚀

The ft_transcendence project is a team project from 42 school, where the goal is to develop a website that allows users to create accounts via the 42 API, play real-time multiplayer games of Pong, and we added a second game called Invaders.

This project is built using the following technologies:

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Django
- JavaScript
- PostgreSQL

We are still working in this project! 👷🏻‍♂️
